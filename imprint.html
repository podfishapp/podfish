    <p>
        As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages in accordance with general laws
        pursuant to § 7 Abs. 1 TMG. However, according to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, we are not obligated to monitor transmitted or
        stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity.
    </p>

    <p>
        Obligations to remove or block the use of information under general law remain unaffected. However, liability in
        this regard is only possible from the time of knowledge of a specific infringement. Upon becoming aware of

    <h2>Liability for Links</h2>

    <p>
        Our offer contains links to external third-party websites, over whose content we have no influence. Therefore,

        always responsible for the content of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal
        violations at the time of linking. Illegal content was not recognizable at the time of linking.
    </p>

    <p>
        However, a permanent content control of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete evidence of a legal
        violation. Upon becoming aware of legal violations, we will remove such links immediately.
